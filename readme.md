#Elevator pitch
Help Aki, the penguin, navigate across the beach filled with disposal waste and reunite with his family.

#inspiration
Our team have met each other at Facebook hackathon earlier this year. After the hackathon, we want to build something for social good together again. As so, we decided to create a game that addressed the issues of pollution. 

One of our team members went to an exhibition on global climate change. By sharing her feelings and thoughts, we got an inspiration to create a game that would remind people about the issues related to climate change. We then researched on the categories for the hackathon under ‘Social Good” and decided to focus on the target of SDG 14.1, which is preventing and reducing marine pollution, this is the SDG we would like to advance. 

The increase in plastic production has led to a larger risk of marine organisms consuming it. Studies show that by 2050 nearly every species of seabird will be accidentally eating plastic debris — and that includes penguins. Eating plastic causes major problems for penguins and other marine animals. If a bird swallows enough plastic, for example, the indigestible scraps can build up in its gut and prevent it from digesting real food.

This sort of information is very worrying, which is why we decided to use this opportunity to create awareness of the situation for penguins. The game about a penguin called “Aki”. During the annual penguin migration from the Antarctic, Aki is separated from his family when the melting iceberg they were living on suddenly breaks and carries Aki away. He finds himself washed up on the Mar Del Plata beach in Argentina. As he tries to navigate the beach, Aki is shocked to find large amounts of trash on the beach. Your mission is to help Aki avoid the debris and try and find his way back into the ocean. 

#what we have learnt
This was our first time creating a game in Spark AR. We got to learn how we can create a running game using this interactive platform. We have learnt on how to create movable backgrounds, how to add different textures to a material, how to create animations, how to add texts to a plane and sound to the effect, etc. 

#how we built it
First, we added the background we wished to use and made a transition of the background and put it in a loop so that it appears as though the character on the screen was moving. We then added the character animations and changed the character’s position in the y coordinate when ‘a blink’ is registered from the user using the effect. This is what makes the character jump. We then added in colliders which were disposal wastes, such as, plastic bottles, plastic bags, and created an animation for that so that they changed over the time. There is a logic that then compares if the x and y coordinates of the character and colliders are the same. If they are, then it results to game over. If there is no collision, then the score is incremented by one. We also got a lot of help from the Spark AR Facebook group community and from the many talented creators. 

#challenges we faced
Learning the different features of Spark AR was a bit of a challenging particularly the patch editor. When creating a game with a lot of logic, it may get confusing to organize the logic and to understand what each block is doing. Another challenge that we spotted was that we originally had our game at the bottom of the screen but when publishing the effect, we noticed that the camera app button options are also at the bottom of the screen. So we had to raise the position of the game to about halfway through the screen height which might not have been the best. Another challenge was finding the appropriate textures for background, the character and colliders. We would have loved to have a much bigger background with more interactive objects.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Even though we live in different continents and time-zones we still managed to work cohesively. Wilfred lives in Africa and Yujin lives in Asia. We collaborated without any barriers using Facebook messenger to communicate most of the time. The cute part of the game is, the movement of penguins, to make it more dynamic, we worked hard on the movements of penguins’ arms to rotate it to a different degree. Also, to maximize the enjoyment of playing games, we wrote a background music for games and picked up a specific sound effect when penguin jumps.

#What’s next for Penguin Saver
One of the areas we want to improve is the background/landscape of the game. We would like to create one that is bigger with a richer design. We would want to have more levels in the game and an ending where Aki finally reunites with his family.

We would like to find a way to help the penguins and many other animals affected by plastic pollution through this game. A feature directly connecting to the Facebook Fundraisers to the game so that people could donate to help organizations working towards protecting animals. 

#what it does
Penguin Saver is a game running in a camera effect where you play as a penguin moving on a beach. The objective is to avoid the trailing plastic debris by jumping. To start the game, the user has to use the front-camera and tap on the screen. During the game play, the user can make the penguin jump by blinking eyes. The score at the top of the screen keeps track of the number of plastic debris Aki avoids. The user loses if Aki collides with the plastic debris.
